/**
 * Transaction of a {@link Task}.
 *
 * <p>Transaction is stateful entity that remembers where current
 * task is and what should be done next in order to finish it ASAP.
 * We implement a two-phase commit (2PC) approach. First, we try
 * to call {@link Step#exec(Context)} on every one of them. If anyone
 * fails (throws an exception), we try to rollback the entire transaction,
 * by calling {@link Step#rollback(Context)} on those steps that
 * were successfully executed up to the moment of failure.
 *
 * <p>Then, when all steps were successfully executed, we try to
 * commit them by calling {@link Step#commit(Context)}. If any of them
 * fails, we just cancel the entire transaction and mark it as failed.
 * We don't rollback anything in this situation.
 *
 * <p>We assume that all steps are designed with this 2PC concept in mind.
 * They all do the most important and critical part inside
 * their {@link Step#exec(Context)} methods. And they except this
 * code to fail. They know how they will rollback in case of failure.
 *
 * <p>Also, we assume that a step will never fail at
 * {@link Step#commit(Context)} phase.
