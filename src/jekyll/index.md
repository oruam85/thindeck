Thindeck is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud service that features:

 * automatic up/down scaling of running nodes

 * every web app node runs in its own Docker container

 * resource usage is charged per second of CPU

 * blue-green automated deployments

 * built-in load balancing

To start working with Thindeck,
go to [www.thindeck.com](http://www.thindeck.com), create a decksitory
and follow the instructions.

There are two sections in the documentation, which are
dedicated mostly to project contributors. If you're only a user
of Thindeck, you can skip them:
[Software Architecture Document (SAD)]({% post_url 2014-04-01-architecture %}) and
[Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](/requs/requs.xml).
