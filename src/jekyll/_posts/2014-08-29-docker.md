  Thindeck is using a pre-defined Docker image
  yegor256/thindeck, which runs Apache2 with PHP5, Perl,
  and Ruby pre-installed
---

`yegor256/thindeck` is our default Docker image that is
used for your web app, unless you have your own `Dockerfile`
in the root directory of your deck.

Our default Docker image starts Apache2 HTTP Server with
PHP5 module enabled.

If you want to extend our image, use this template (for example, to
run a Sinatra web app):

{% highlight bash %}
FROM yegor256/thindeck
RUN sudo gem install sinatra
CMD ruby hi.rb
{% endhighlight %}
